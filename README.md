# Full Stack JavaScript Project 1

This was a simple "vanilla" JavaScript look at writing a quote to the DOM.  In this project I practiced my knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax and data structures by building a Random Quote Generator, a program that displays a randomly selected quote each time the user clicks a button.  For extra credit, I also made the background color change randomly with the new quote and added a SetInterval to the page in order to automatically rotate the quote.
